Most of us are actually starving, seeking nothing but a warm meal every day. And this is quite the dream! Also, quite a lot can afford more than they themselves can comprehend. Yet it’s often the case that no one would even consider balancing this scale. Giving more than just a very little margin of what we own is considered almost heroic. We picture this act of charity as stepping to another level for just a little portion of our time. Almost like feeding a caged predator, throwing the food, and swiftly pulling our hands out. Watching from a distance, feeling good being on the other side, and getting satisfied by dipping our toes just a little bit in the deep water before it gets actually dangerous.

This varies greatly by the _level_ we’re currently in. And we never stop planning for the next level, often not for any proper reason but not stalling in our current level, while the _competition_ is miles ahead. Like a perpetual engine, that never stops or degrades. And much like so, can’t exist. This game of levels is a basic notion that we’re all aware of, much like most bad habits, we are not serious about changing it. Not that it will change, it’s the way of the world, but it ultimately could _and should_ be addressed.

Being burdened by your level’s predefined issues and goals is _(to put it nicely)_ delusional. As exhausting as it is, it’s actually limiting and blinding too. You get to gaze miserably at the next level contemplating yourself amongst the higher-ups just because of the sense of limitation you’re getting. Even if you don’t really need or want what’s up there–It’s just that you don’t like being restrained.

And it’s not news that no matter how up high you are, there’s always more, the staircase doesn’t end; the one at the top is already extending it, to maintain a reasonable distance. It becomes a necessity to rid yourself of excess luggage for lighter mobility. But what you considered essential years ago, is now just a dead weight weighing you down. slowing your climb, and pulling you under. And at the unreachable top, you find out you almost rid yourself of everything that was once you. And it doesn’t really matter what level you’re in; you’re making the same mistake, racing up and throwing your dirt over everyone else below. while making the dirt look more appealing to those below, participating in the same race, in a slightly different context.

As you’re climbing up, glimpsing over the corpses of those who were arguably less unfortunate. You may realize it’s quite stupid. But this very thought means you have to stop soaring to assess that you might have been behaving stupidly yourself. _But Oh would you look at the time! People are already catching up, and it’s quite illogical that I’m being stupid; I’m doing quite well thank you. It’s too late anyway_.
