We fear the dark. We fear loneliness. We can’t hear our own thoughts over the coiling noise surrounding our every stay. There’s not much change to expect when all we do is running aimlessly, blindfolded without aid–We will fade.

Our thoughts are no longer rooted to us. Our beliefs come from a collective pool of shared, familiar ideas that did not originate from a thought process, but rather from a distributed knowledge base that is no longer up for amendment or doubt.

It’s a convenient idea to take things for granted, but never a good one. Taking thoughts for granted is the worst insult one could incur. Completely charged by an idea that’s not yours, sailing ship towards a port you never desired. Not knowing what to expect. For you never bothered to make an authentic, coherent thought about it yourself.

Solitude is remedy for many ailments. One would spend months and years with their own company and nothing more, living with their thoughts and contemplations, looking at life from an unsullied perspective as if it’s someone else’s to evaluate and correct their faults and peel off the façades that keep on clogging their vision.

Oneliness is a natural state we can _(foolishly)_ perceive negatively. Even though it’s crucial for one’s intellectual and judgmental growth. When you finally can hear your own thoughts, you will find the fallacies in them. When you are shocked at the strange voice that rings in your head in an unfamiliar tone, you’ll realize it was never yours. But you lived by it everyday.
