I see an immortal tree. Breathing throughout the ages. Not counting days. Observing changes. Recording phrases of peoples’ brief phases. In different times and places.

I see mankind, divided and shrinking by the minute, and many minutes have passed. Where people would kill each other in the name of what’s most absurd.

> But I must eat!

I see men, drawing lines to claim a piece of land, much like child play.
I see a young lad, Inheriting a fortune of man-made rules and foolish desires.

I see a fool, now fighting for his heritage. Against the other fools. All alike, except for whom is more entitled to their heritage. Without a need for a premonition to conceive.

I see a wise fool now victor. Realising what he was full of before was a hollowed figure. But admitting this is also admitting that he was a fool, _we can’t have that!_
The wise fool now teaches his heirs to protect their dynasty, and not to be like the others—fools.

I see the wise fools, moved only by the will of a bigger fool. Doing what they were taught is right, and never for a greater truth.

I see a man, killing his peer. Never before, to even kill a deer. But in a different time, without a shard of fear. It’s much forgiven to stain and smear.

I see a tree. Immortal and free. On waters most clear. Always straight, with roots of steel. No matter where the fools steer. Be it tomorrow or yesteryear. Belonging to nothing, but to a truth longing as far as can see.

> _People should stop boasting about their fathers who have died, while they are but coals of Hell, or they will be more humiliated with Allah than the dung beetle who rolls dung with his nose. Indeed Allah has removed the pride of Jahiliyyah from you, and its boasting about lineage. [Indeed a person is either] a pious believer, or a miserable sinner. And people are all the children of Adam, and Adam was [created] from dust_. \
