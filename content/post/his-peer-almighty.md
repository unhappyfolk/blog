Your idol, your mentor. A role model, a professor.  Most knowledgeable, one to die for. Most righteous, above all soared. A human, yet he is more.

He has all control, to cast you away, or lore you before. He keeps the gates of Heavens, and to Hell he leaves the door. A human, yet you make him more.

He lies, he robs. Mountains of sins he holds—a secret to behold. He rapes, he kills. He cares not about his sins. A human, yet you follow him still.

The middle man, your gateway to Heavens. You shall not pass, unless he lets you in. Never appointed, or of a divine will. Accept him, lest you’re thrown in hell. A human, in the same grave he dwells.

Another, delivers the word. The chosen one, an earthly lord. Speaks the truth, divine, and good. He’s but a messenger, to unhappy folk. He is no Judge, he acquires no gold. Seeks no control, nor claims to be God. Human, also. The only one to follow and uphold.

> _Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I am only a man like you, ˹but˺ it has been revealed to me that your God is only One God. So whoever hopes for the meeting with their Lord, let them do good deeds and associate none in the worship of their Lord.”_
> **[Chapter 18 (The Cave)](https://quran.com/18?startingVerse=110)**

> _They have taken their rabbis and monks as well as the Messiah, son of Mary, as lords besides Allah, even though they were commanded to worship none but One God. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. Glorified is He above what they associate ˹with Him˺!_
> **[Chapter 9 (Atonement)](https://quran.com/9?startingVerse=31)**
