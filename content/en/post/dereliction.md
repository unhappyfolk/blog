How do I seek answers, \
If I don't know the Questions? \
*"Thou shalt not feel guilt"* \
Yet I seek Redemption \
*“Righteous, Kind, and Virtuous”* \
Full of self-conviction \
*“Pure as the running waters”* \
Drowning in my illusory perfection \
While deep 'neath the darkness \
Sprouts my rotten Dereliction 


> _Say: "Shall we tell you of those who lose most in respect of their deeds?_ \
> _Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought that they were acquiring good by their works?"_ \
> _They are those who deny the Signs of their Lord and the fact of their having to meet Him (in the Hereafter): vain will be their works, nor shall We, on the Day of Judgment, give them any weight._ \
— __[Surah 18 (The Cave)](https://quran.com/18?startingVerse=103).__
