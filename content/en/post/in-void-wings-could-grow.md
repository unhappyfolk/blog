“Flee! In haste you must go \
Clear your mind, your soul \
Catch! Life’s beauty and glow \
Pray, for serenity’s warm blow”

Vested, your hardships, your flaws \
Bested, ambitions and your goals \
Tested, flesh, brain, and soul \
Wasted, breath, heat, and all

Void, it was and Void it is \
Void, before and to the edge \
Void, is warmth, and cold again \
Void, is more than nothingness

Within Void, beasts that roam, \
Vermin, swine, down and low \
Bored, and filthy they endure \
Till Void consumes the flesh, \
And their debt is paid in soul

Within Void, the wise fools groan \
Tears, and lies they spawn, and \
Cast in red like blood, the Void \
And dowse it in forgetful cologne

The Void, moulded as they please \
It’s black, cold, endless, and bleak \
Or vivid, warm, with a caressing release \
To Hell or Heaven–is what they plead

Within Void, wings could grow \
The wise fools now–a Murder of Crows \
Yet in the Void, soaring above all \
A Hawk liberated, doomed like all

To Heaven or to Hell? \
Nowhere else to go \
Soaring and flapping, \
Awaiting death’s blow

Anticipating the caress, \
Of Void’s only goal \
Wretched, and frightened, \
Bored, yet tirelessly afloat
