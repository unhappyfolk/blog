Foolishly and hastily took an oath, \
To ache and suffer for a cause, \
Powerless, I cannot fulfill it, \
Nor to it shall I get close.

Forbidden to undo what I have brought, \
Upon myself or what I’ve thought, \
I must obey then in fear of pain, \
Agony, disdain, and eternal onslaught.

A thrall I am, and I live to serve, \
I do as I’m told but not with verve, \
For I’d rather go back and cease to be, \
Or stay here—a barren tree.

Blissed and grateful as I am, \
Saved and protected from all harm, \
I can’t but contemplate I was forced, \
For never have I asked to be invoked.

I was given a choice indeed, but I \
Hadn’t had the wisdom to deny, \
For my ignorance spans the sky, \
And I must bear my word to die.

How many faults have I committed? \
And commands and deeds I disobeyed? \
And how not have I been punished? \
Or smitten to dust for what I did?

The cause is hard, and I’m futile. \
The task is there, and I’m far behind. \
Yet I’m forgiven for my crimes, \
And blissed again in my grind, \
Blissed for no worth of mine, \
Blissed again countless times.

I shall then submit as I must, \
Ever grateful—The rule is just, \
Acknowledged is my weakness, \
Accounted for is my earthly lust.

A thrall I am, and I volunteer, \
To serve and obey not only in fear, \
For I can tolerate what I’ve been tasked, \
And for Mercy and Forgiveness I can ask.

But if upon myself I can decree, \
Where the cause is hard, and I’m but a meek \
I’d rather go back and cease to be, \
Or stay here—a barren tree.
