The mighty rock was afloat; a mountain, a pillar of earth was swung above its vast shadows. The crushing cloud was dropped. And every thing beneath was no more.

From ashes, the remains were brought. And the lifeless corpse was rendered before. What an unearthly show! Indeed trickery is what we saw.

_“Lord, halt thy sun!”_ A prayer in battle. _“Split the moon!”_ A challenge from the unworthy. _Show me a sign!_ An order from the lesser.

_Lord, prove thy signs to me!_ \
A thousand miracles more. \
_Another, O Lord, to see!_ \
Be nothing. Be once more. \
_It’s but foul magic!_ \
_Nothing to fall for_ \
Who brings back the bones \
Of long forgotten yore \
Blinded is man \
Forevermore

Heard you the sound \
Of the proof? \
Or have you seen \
The light aloof? \
If you see it as day, \
And hear it sway \
You wouldn’t believe still, \
Or follow its starry way

> Nothing keeps Us from sending the ˹demanded˺ signs except that they had ˹already˺ been denied by earlier peoples. And We gave Thamûd the she-camel as a clear sign, but they wrongfully rejected it. We only send the signs as a warning. \
 — [Chapter 17 (The Journey of the Night)](https://quran.com/17/59)

> Those who say, “Allah has commanded us not to believe in any messenger unless he brings us an offering to be consumed by fire ˹from the sky˺.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Other prophets did in fact come to you before me with clear proofs and ˹even˺ what you demanded—why then did you kill them, if what you say is true?” \
— [Chapter 3 (The House of Imran)](https://quran.com/3/183)

> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Had there been angels walking the earth, well settled, We would have surely sent down for them an angel from heaven as a messenger.” \
— [Chapter 17 (The Journey of the Night)](https://quran.com/17/95)
