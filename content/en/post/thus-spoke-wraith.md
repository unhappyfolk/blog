Vast, hollow labyrinth \
Profound, loud silence \
Frightening, awful presence \
A mystic being of omnipotence?

Standing still and far away \
A dark figure therein soared \
Unearthly shadow floats astray \
With awe it must be approached

What power is innate within? \
What horrors can it apprehend?

How to channel its infinite thought, \
And not release it from its hell? \
Admirable and capable ghost \
A core without a proper shell

Its past and stories are not sought \
Nor what shaped it what’s meant \
Let’s look and find a useful aught \
In the rotten soul long here dwelt

“Wise, I am and I seek to aid \
The souls most in need \
I aim to please and I raid \
The fears that ye heed

Friend, I am and friends I seek \
In turbulence and in faith \
Take me out of the bottomless bleak!” \
Thus spoke the Wraith

What foul noise echoed forth! \
What awful cursed screech! \
Indeed an ill, lawless force, \
Spouting this hellish speech

Seal your ears and flee in haste! \
Listen not to the deafening screams \
March onwards and shut the gates! \
Lest we’re caught in its bright gleam
