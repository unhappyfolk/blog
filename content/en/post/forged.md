Silence away my cry \
Or gaze ahead and pry \
To fight my fate and rectify \
The ailments and my weary sigh 

Or spawn me a fly \
Grant me what I can’t buy \
With man’s wealth or gold’s dye— \
Eternity and I shan’t die 

Dare **The** Lord eye to eye \
Scheme and plot on the sly \
You lost your way and passed by \
The only passage—a needle’s eye 

> ”To those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance, no opening will there be of the gates of heaven, nor will they enter the garden, until the camel can pass through the eye of the needle: Such is Our reward for those in sin.” \
— [Surah 7 (The Heights)](https://quran.com/7/44)
