Beat the drums of war to feud \
Blow the trumpets loud and rude \
Make way and brace for a magnitude \
Of the wise fool’s rising aptitude

Roaming about for lust and food \
To him the earth beneath subdued \
By a dream he breathed and was consumed \
To bond and see his presence approved

He gives but to his own brood \
And all others are mere crudes \
Awakened now he rose to brood \
How time has left him ridiculed

By [Tongues of Flames](/post/tongues-of-flame) his worth is fuelled \
Selflessness is not to act amused \
But disdain for self and all accused \
Of righteousness proclaimed and bestowed \

 _"__And let none disturb his [Solitude](/post/solitude)!__"_
