Pride and arrogance are my traits \
Lies and misdeeds shadow my face \
Lost yet confident in my pace, \
I slip into my tiny grave

Pride and arrogance form my shell \
Within I hide what’s foul and ill \
I cry _“I’m doing well!”_ \
And bless my self for the massive bill \
I cry _“Am I doing well?”_ \
And bless my self for my mere will

Pride and arrogance mask my sorrow \
Left to the pill of joy I swallow \
Till it fades away again in the morrow \
And the hollow is reclaimed by my wailing marrow

Pride and arrogance wherever I went \
And all I sought was a praise in print \
_“Deny the instinct that you felt!”_ \
I hear the applause for what I dealt \
_“Harvest the spark of what’s burnt_, \
_and waste no time in Lament”_

Pride and arrogance are my bandits \
Took my eyes and left me stranded \
I pray now to die yet never have I been granted \
And ever-doomed was my gambit

> “Every soul will taste death. And you will only receive your full reward on the Day of Judgment. Whoever is hauled from the Fire and is admitted into Paradise will ˹indeed˺ triumph, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment.” \

> “Wise is the one who calls himself to account, and does noble deeds to benefit him after death; and fool is the one who subdues himself to his temptations and desires and seeks from Allah the fulfilment of his vain desires” \
