This is apophatic theology in verse—defining God by negation, stripping away false human projections. The friend offers "cloaks" (attributes mortals desire: immortality, wealth, power), presuming divinity is merely amplified humanity. 

The second stanza ventriloquises mankind's self-made gods: tyrants demanding worship, cosmic dictators modelled on earthly kings. This is what "mortal men make or claim"—gods in our image, satisfying our psychological needs for order, meaning, and hierarchy.

The volta reveals these are category errors. A true god cannot be *sought* like an achievement or worn like a cloak. The friend's limp symbolises human limitation—we stumble even in conception. "What is a god but a limping meek?" inverts the question: from within mortality, all our god-concepts are crippled approximations.

The closing trinity—"Omnipotence, Singularity, The Divine He"—points toward authentic divinity: absolute power beyond mortal wielding, radical unity transcending pantheons, and essence ("He") irreducible to attributes. True godhood is "incomprehensible," not through mystical obscurity but categorical difference—as inaccessible to human framework as colour to the blind. We limp because we cannot walk where gods stride."""

On roads of dirt and slime we walked  
Of hopes and dreams we wished and talked  
_“If given the choice, what would you take for a cloak?_  
_Immortal, Powerful, Wealthy or High afloat?_  
_Or Ruling, or cruising the seas is what you sought?”_  
Asked the friend, on his limp, as we talked  

Why have one, if I want all?  
Why do I choose, if I can call  
And point to make what’s broken whole  
And shake the very earth to fall  
Beneath the world and the appalled  

All would abide by my law  
Of their every thought and whim I know  
And all would perish on my servant’s blow  
For all is mine and below  
I made you and by my will you grow,  
And live and age and see my glow  

_“**A** god you want to be?”_  
Stumbled the friend on his limping knee  
What is **a** god but **a** limping meek?  
A cloak is not what I seek  
Nor **a** god I desire to be  
But you asked what’s power to me  
And power is not a cloak or three  
It's incomprehensible for the likes of me  
Omnipotence, Singularity, **The** Divine He  

> Say: "He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.” \
