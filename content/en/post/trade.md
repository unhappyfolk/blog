I'd give away all wealth \
If you'd be so kind to trade Death \
For this life is not worth the breath

O sweet release for me to come \
Rid my soul off the foul boredom  

The sight of a grave far away \
Down next to it I yearn to lay  

O **Lord** have mercy on a free soul \
Rendered its years to another's yore  

> ألا موتٌ يُباع فأشتريه
— الوزير المهلبي
