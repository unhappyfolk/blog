__Deep beneath dove the roots, \
The Earth itself and entangled, \
Strong and plump as they shoot, \
The mighty tree rises hardened.__

_“No tree is mightier than I am, \
No tree can bear what I can tell. \
On solid ground I stand and chant: \
No harm comes out of my good will._

_Come, rest and take shade \
By my leaves and lie thee still. \
Don’t mind me casting ill charades. \
My roots are solid and I mean well.”_

__The shade was there, \
And moonlight fell, \
No pain to spare; \
It’s a smoke rose to kill.__

_“Cursed be thee, treacherous tree! \
Your shade has poisoned me! \
I took your fruits and roped your leaves. \
I made my deathbed and killed my steed.”_

_“Ungrateful Fool, don’t thou blame me! \
I did thee nothing but good deeds. \
What fault to bear if I can’t see \
What lies ahead of thee and me?”_

_How darest thou question me? \
Wherein my good will showers thee. \
You bathed in the ignorance of my sea, \
And I laid my kindness upon thee._

_Thy steed shall rot, and thou shall die. \
My leaves grow higher and more high. \
For I’m ignorant, and thou art like me, \
But I intend well, and my roots go deep.”_

Likewise, a man who does not know what is right and judges people with ignorance, will be in the Hell-fire." \
